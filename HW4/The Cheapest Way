The weight of a pate is the sum of the integers in each of the n cells of the matrix that are visited. 
  The minimum paths through two slightly different 5X6 matrices are shown below.
  The matrix values differ only in the bottom row. The path for the matrix on the right takes advantage of the adjacency between the first and last rows.

<Input>
The weight of a pate is the sum of the integers in each of the n cells of the matrix that are visited. 
  The minimum paths through two slightly different 5X6 matrices are shown below.
  The matrix values differ only in the bottom row. The path for the matrix on the right takes advantage of the adjacency between the first and last rows.

<Output>
Two lines should be output for each matrix specification. The first line represents a minimal-weight path, and the second line is the cost of this minimal path.
If there is more that  one path of minimal weight, the lexicographically smallest path should be output.
