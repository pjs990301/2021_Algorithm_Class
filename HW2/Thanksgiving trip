A group of students are members of a club that travels annually to different location during the long thanksgiving holidays. 
This holiday they are planning a trip to Jeju-do. 

The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally, but it is not practical things, such as meals, hotels, taxi rides, and plane tickets.
After the trip, each student’s expenses are tallied and money is exchanged so that the net cost to each is the same, to within 10 won. 
In the past, this money exchanges has been tedious and time consuming. 
Your job is to compute, from a list of expenses, the minimum amount of money that must change hands in order to equalize (within one won) all the students’ costs.

Input
Standard input will contain the information for several trips. Each trip consists of a line containing a positive integer n denoting the number of student on the trip. 
This is followed by n lines of input, each containing the amount spent by a student in 10 won units. 
There are no more than 100 students and no student spent more than 100,000 won. 
A single line containing 0 follows the information for the last trip.

Output
For each trip, output a line stating the total amount of money, in won units, that must be exchanged to equalize the students’ costs.
